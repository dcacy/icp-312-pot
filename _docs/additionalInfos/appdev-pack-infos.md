The Domino 10 AppDev Pack module provides a promise based JavaScript interface for accessing data in a Domino database. 
<br />
It uses the **gRPC protocol** to create, read, update and delete database objects. 
<br />
It uses the **Domino Query Facility (DQF)** to perform bulk operations on all documents matching a query, thereby reducing transactions and 
resulting in improved performance. The DominoDB module requires the **Proton add-in **on your Domino server.
