1. The **domino-db** package has already been downloaded to your image; it's in the Downloads directory.  To install it, type `npm install c:\users\ibmuser\Downloads\domino-domino-db-1.1.0.tgz` and hit Enter.

1. The installation will proceed, and when it is finished you can type the `dir` command to see that a `node_modules` directory has been created.  The **domino-db** package has been installed.  You are ready to proceed to the first exercise.  Leave the command prompt open, as you'll use it in the exercises which follow.
