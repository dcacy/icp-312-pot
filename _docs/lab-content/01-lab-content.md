In this lab, you'll be using a Windows 10 image (called in this documentation the "client image") which is fully configured to run the exercises in the lab.  Specifically, the image has the following products installed:

- node.js v10.15.1
- The domino-db npm package v1.1.0
- The Atom text editor v1.34.0
- Domino Designer, Domino Administrator, and IBM Notes, all v10.0.1

The client image is available via a web browser. You'll be able to interact with the image as though it were a local desktop, but _only through the browser_. Do not try to use the actual computer in front of you; use the browser instead.

Each exercise has concepts which build upon the previous one. Feel free to look ahead, but please understand that you may skip a concept in doing so.

NOTE: In this lab, you will have access to your own Domino v10 server. You have Administrator rights to the server, so it is possible that you can execute a command which causes the server to stop functioning. Please use caution when making changes on the server!

Use the Next and Previous buttons at the bottom of each page to proceed through the lab.

Let's get started!
